As of 21/Mar/2013 
Fitocracy now defaults to sorting the performance drop-down alphabetically now anyways, so this is no longer required :+1:


FitocracyDropdownSorter
=======================

Basic Chrome extension to sort the Performance drop-down.

By default it's sorted by frequency of excersise, but IMHO it's better to be sorted alphabetically! :)

To-do:

* Add Jasmine js tests
* Make my own icons
* Get it code-reviewed and looked at to make sure I haven't done something stupid...
